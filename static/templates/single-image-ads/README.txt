In order to see this ad as a standalone AMP page add the amp-story-visible
attribute to the <body> tag of the ad. Please remove it when you are ready to
upload the ad to your platform to ensure the ads animations only play when the
story has started.

Note that even with the amp-story-visible attribute added, the template will
still not render as shown in the preview image on https://amp.dev/. There are a
few reasons for this:

- Assets (videos, etc.) have been intentionally blurred.
- Parts of the preview (the "Ad" overlay in the top left corner, and the CTA
  button itself) are generated by the ad runtime, which is not available when
  developing locally. These will only appear when the ad is uploaded to your ad
  platform.
